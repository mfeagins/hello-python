# AI-First Agentic Project Structure (for VS Code + GitHub Copilot)

This project demonstrates a folder structure inspired by agentic, AI-First software development (as seen in Cursor AI), adapted for Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot in Agent mode.

## Folder Overview

- **agents/**: Contains code for AI agents that automate tasks or interact with users.
- **prompts/**: Stores prompt templates to guide agent behavior.
- **workflows/**: Defines automated workflows for agents (YAML, scripts, etc.).
- **data/**: Example datasets or input files for agents.
- **logs/**: Logs of agent actions and decisions.
- **docs/**: Documentation for students and contributors.
- **tests/**: Automated tests for agentic code.

## How to Use

- Explore each folder for example files and comments explaining their purpose.
- Use GitHub Copilot in Agent mode to automate coding, generate documentation, and run tests.
- While VS Code does not offer all Cursor AI features, this structure supports agentic workflows and AI-driven development practices.

## For Students

Review the `docs/overview.md` for a summary of each folder's role. Experiment with creating new agents, prompts, and workflows to see how AI can assist in software development.
