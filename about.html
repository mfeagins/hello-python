                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, where I grew up and developed my passion for technology and problem-solving. 
                    I completed my undergraduate studies at Miami University, where I gained a strong foundation in business and technology. 
                    After graduation, I worked for a year as an Oracle Cloud ERP implementor, where I gained valuable hands-on experience 
                    in enterprise software implementation and client management.
                </p>

                <h3>Current Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems (MSIS) to build a stronger technical foundation and 
                    enhance my client-facing skills. This program is helping me bridge the gap between technical implementation 
                    and strategic business solutions, preparing me for more advanced roles in technology consulting and enterprise solutions.
                </p>

                <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My goal is to become a well-rounded technology professional who can effectively communicate complex technical 
                    concepts to clients while delivering innovative solutions. I'm particularly interested in cloud technologies, 
                    enterprise resource planning systems, and the intersection of technology and business strategy.
                </p>

                    solutions are accessible and valuable to clients and end-users. I'm committed to lifelong learning
